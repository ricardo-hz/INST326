Doing this allows the programmer to insert expressions into the string by using a set of curly braces, rather than the more common concatenation operator (+) seen in other programming languages and earlier versions of Python. The general python syntax for this is ```print(f\"STRING {EXPRESSION}\")```."

    "## Lists\n",
    "In Python, lists are a container data type with an ordered sequence. In other words, lists in Python can consist of other Python data types, and the order of these types within the list is important. Python lists have many methods, two of the most important being the ```.extend()``` method and the ```.append()``` method. Both methods allow you to add to a list, however, their use cases differ. You can also add to a list by using the ```+``` or ```+=``` operators.\n",
    "* ```.extend()```\n",
    "    * The ```.extend()``` method is used to add elements from iterable data types to the end of a python list. When using this method to add a list to a list, the elements from the second list will be added to the end of the first list. When using this method to add a string to a list, each char will be broken up first, then each char will be added to the end of the list. The general syntax of this method is ```list.extend(iterable)```.\n",
    "* ```+ or +=```\n",
    "    * These two operators work very similarly to the ```.extend()``` method. The proper syntax when using these operators to add to lists is ```list = list + iterable``` or ```list += iterable```.\n",
    "* ```.append()```\n",
    "    * The ```.append()``` method is used to add iterable objects in their entirety to the end of a python list. When using this method to add a list to a list, the resulting list will be a list of n-dimensions. When you have a list of n-dimensions, you must use an n-dimensional number of square brackets (2D list example: ```LIST[index0][index1]```) to access the elements in the nested lists. You should use this method when you wish to add the entirety of a string to a list rather than just the characters from the string."
