    "An assert statement tells Python to verify an expression. The general syntax for an assert statement is either ```assert EXPRESSION == VALUE``` or ```assert EXPRESSION == VALUE, (\"ERROR MESSAGE\")```. When the assert statement evaluates to True, the program continues running as normal. When the assert statement evaluates to false, the program will halt and throw an exception."
