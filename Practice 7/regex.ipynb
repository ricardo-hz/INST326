    "People who work at dunderpoodle.com have predictable email addresses. The username consists of the first letter of their first name plus their full last name. This is followed by an @ sign and the division of the company that they work in (sales, research, shipping, etc.), then a period and dunderpoodle.com. For example, Fred Smith from HR has the email ```fsmith@hr.dunderpoodle.com```; Roberta Jones from billing has the email ```rjones@billing.dunderpoodle.com```. Write a regular expression to match an email from dunderpoodle.com with separate capturing groups for the first initial, last name, and division."
